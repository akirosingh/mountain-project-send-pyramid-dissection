View your rock climbing sends on [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/), organized by grade and send type (redpoint, onsight, or flash).

## Features

- TODO: fill this out

## Install

[**Chrome** extension]() <!-- TODO: Add chrome extension link inside parenthesis -->

## Contribution

You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed if you want to play around with the code.

1. This project was bootstrapped with [Chrome Extension CLI](https://github.com/dutiyesh/chrome-extension-cli). Install this tool globally:

```
npm install -g chrome-extension-cli
```

2. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/melissapthai/mountain-project-send-chart.git
cd mountain-project-send-chart
```

3. Install dependencies, and build the app to get it ready to add to Chrome:

```
npm install && npm run build
```

You should now see a `/build` directory at the project root.

You can also run a suite of other nifty commands to make development easier, just check out the [Chrome Extension CLI docs](https://github.com/dutiyesh/chrome-extension-cli#npm-run-watch).

4. Load the app into Chrome:
   a) Open **chrome://extensions**
   b) Check the **Developer mode checkbox**
   c) Click on the **Load unpacked extension** button
   d) Select the folder **mountain-project-send-chart/build**

And that's it!
